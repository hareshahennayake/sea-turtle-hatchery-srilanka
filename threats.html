                <h1>TURTLE CONSERVVATION PROCESS</h1>
                <p>mainly turtles are conserved in srilanka with the help opf other nations as this crature      is     a heritage for all of us in srilkanka.Sea turtle conservation status in 2023
                    Sea turtles spend most of their lives in the water. Throughout their lifetimes, some species cross entire ocean basins. Adult females come ashore once a year to build a nest and lay their eggs. Males, however, may not leave the ocean at all after hatching.<br>

                    
                    For that very reason, it is difficult for scientists to study these marine animals. Much of todayâ€™s knowledge is derived from analyzing and tagging females when they climb out of the water for nesting. Based upon the declining numbers of nesting females, sea turtle populations are estimated to be at significant risk of extinction.<br>

                    different programms havve been introduced to conserve available turtle population due to high risk of getting endangered.Therefore, different foreign countries have been contributed with humour to protect turtlr population from high risks.
